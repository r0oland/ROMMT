% General about standard microscopy
By magnifying minuscule cellular and subcellular features, optical microscopes provide a powerful tool for studying tissue components and their dynamic interactions. Its excellent imaging contrast in soft tissue has made optical microscopy the most widely used imaging modality in the biomedical community.\cite{2000_Amos_Lessonsfromhistory}  

The visual power of optical microscopy relies on sharp optical focusing. Such power is rapidly reduced as photons travel deeper into biological tissue, a highly scattering medium for electromagnetic waves in the optical spec- tral range. When photons reach the optical diffusion limit ($\approx \unit[1]{mm}$ in tissue), they have typically undergone tens of scattering events, which randomize the photon paths and thus prevent tight focusing~\cite{2000_Fujimoto_Opticalcoherencetomography:}

Although modern optical microscopic techniques have released biologists from the con?nes of ten-micrometer-thick ex vivo tissue slices to a world of volumetric in vivo tissue, optical microscopy is still challenged to image at depths beyond the optical diffusion limit while maintaining high resolution. For decades, engineers have made scant progress by using pure optical approaches to light scattering.
