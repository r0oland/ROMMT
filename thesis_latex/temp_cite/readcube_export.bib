  abstract={Optical coherence tomography {(OCT)} is an emerging technology for performing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. {OCT} is analogous to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound. {OCT} can provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the micron scale in situ and in real time. Using {OCT} in combination with catheters and endoscopes enables high-resolution intraluminal imaging of organ systems. {OCT} can function as a type of optical biopsy and is a powerful imaging technology for medical diagnostics because unlike conventional histopathology which requires removal of a tissue specimen and processing for microscopic examination, {OCT} can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time. {OCT} can be used where standard excisional biopsy is hazardous or impossible, to reduce sampling errors associated with excisional biopsy, and to guide interventional procedures. In this paper, we review {OCT} technology and describe its potential biomedical and clinical applications.}
