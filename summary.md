## Intro
- term "photoacoustics" (PA) or "optoacoustics" (OA) refers to the generation of acoustic waves by modulated optical radiation
- photoacoustics can mean the generation of acoustic waves or other thermoelastic effects by any type of energetic radiation, including electromagnetic radiation from radio frequency to x ray, electrons, protons, ions, and other particles
- applications in various fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, and medicine
- methods: 
	- PA spectroscopy
	- PA monitoring of deexcitation processes
	- PA probing of thermoelastic and other physical properties of materials
	- PA generation of mechanical motions

## Principle

- most PA generation is due to the deposition of heat by light, the so-called "photothermal" (PT) effect
- "Photothermal effects" are caused by the heating of a sample after the absorption of optical energy (or, in general, the absorption of an energetic beam)
- after optical absorption, other deexcitation channels besides heating can also occur
