  abstract = {Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) represents the most frequent clinical aspect
	of cardio/microvascular involvement and is a key feature of several
	autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Moreover, RP is associated in a statistically
	significant manner with many coronary diseases. In normal conditions
	or in primary RP (excluding during the cold-exposure test), the normal
	nailfold capillaroscopic pattern shows a regular disposition of the
	capillary loops along with the nailbed. On the contrary, in subjects
	suffering from secondary RP, one or more alterations of the capillaroscopic
	findings should alert the physician of the possibility of a connective
	tissue disease not yet detected. Nailfold capillaroscopy (NV) represents
	the best method to analyse microvascular abnormalities in autoimmune
	rheumatic diseases. Architectural disorganization, giant capillaries,
	haemorrhages, loss of capillaries, angiogenesis and avascular areas
	characterize >95% of patients with overt scleroderma (SSc). The term
	‘SSc pattern’ includes, all together, these sequential capillaroscopic
	changes typical to the microvascular involvement in SSc. The capillaroscopic
	aspects observed in dermatomyositis and in the undifferentiated connective
	tissue disease are generally reported as ‘SSc-like pattern’.
	Effectively, and early in the disease, the peripheral microangiopathy
	may be well recognized and studied by nailfold capillaroscopy, or
	better with nailfold video capillaroscopy (NVC). The early differential
	diagnosis between primary and secondary RP is the best advantage
	NVC may offer. In addition, interesting capillaroscopic changes have
	been observed in systemic lupus erythematosus, anti-phospholipid
	syndrome and Sjogren's syndrome. Further epidemiological and clinical
	studies are needed to better standardize the NCV patterns. In future,
	the evaluation of nailfold capillaroscopy in autoimmune rheumatic
	diseases might represent a tool for the prediction of microvascular
	heart involvement by considering the systemic microvascular derangement
	at the capillary nailfold.},

  abstract = {Optical contrast agents have been widely applied to enhance the sensitivity
	and specificity of optical imaging with near-infrared {(NIR)} light.
	However, because of the overwhelming scattering of light in biological
	tissues, the spatial resolution of traditional optical imaging degrades
	drastically as the imaging depth increases. Here, for the first time
	to our knowledge, we present noninvasive photoacoustic angiography
	of animal brains in vivo with {NIR} light and an optical contrast
	agent. When indocyanine green polyethylene glycol, a novel absorption
	dye with prolonged clearance, is injected into the circulatory system
	of a rat, it obviously enhances the absorption contrast between the
	blood vessels and the background tissues. Because {NIR} light can
	penetrate deep into the brain tissues through the skin and skull,
	we are able to successfully reconstruct the vascular distribution
	in the rat brain from the photoacoustic signals. On the basis of
	differential optical absorption with and without contrast enhancement,
	a photoacoustic angiograph of a rat brain is acquired that matches
	the anatomical photograph well and exhibits high spatial resolution
	and a much-reduced background. This new technology demonstrates the
