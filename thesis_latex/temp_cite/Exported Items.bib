	abstract = {Although optical absorption is strongly associated with the physiological status of biological tissue, existing high-resolution optical imaging modalities, including confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy and optical coherence tomography, do not sense optical absorption directly. Furthermore, optical scattering prevents these methods from imaging deeper than 1 mm below the tissue surface. Here we report functional photoacoustic microscopy ({fPAM)}, which provides multiwavelength imaging of optical absorption and permits high spatial resolution beyond this depth limit with a ratio of maximum imaging depth to depth resolution greater than 100. Reflection mode, rather than orthogonal or transmission mode, is adopted because it is applicable to more anatomical sites than the others. {fPAM} is demonstrated with in vivo imaging of angiogenesis, melanoma, hemoglobin oxygen saturation ({sO2)} of single vessels in animals and total hemoglobin concentration in humans.},

	abstract = {Photoacoustic microscopy ({PAM)} is a hybrid in vivo imaging technique that acoustically detects optical contrast via the photoacoustic effect. Unlike pure optical microscopic techniques, {PAM} takes advantage of the weak acoustic scattering in tissue and thus breaks through the optical diffusion limit (∼1 mm in soft tissue). With its excellent scalability, {PAM} can provide high-resolution images at desired maximum imaging depths up to a few millimeters. Compared with backscattering-based confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography, {PAM} provides absorption contrast instead of scattering contrast. Furthermore, {PAM} can image more molecules, endogenous or exogenous, at their absorbing wavelengths than fluorescence-based methods, such as wide-field, confocal, and multi-photon microscopy. Most importantly, {PAM} can simultaneously image anatomical, functional, molecular, flow dynamic and metabolic contrasts in vivo. Focusing on state-of-the-art developments in {PAM}, this Review discusses the key features of {PAM} implementations and their applications in biomedical studies.},

	abstract = {Photoacoustics has been broadly studied in biomedicine, for both human and small animal tissues. Photoacoustics uniquely combines the absorption contrast of light or radio frequency waves with ultrasound resolution. Moreover, it is non-ionizing and non-invasive, and is the fastest growing new biomedical method, with clinical applications on the way. This review provides a brief recap of recent developments in photoacoustics in biomedicine, from basic principles to applications. The emphasized areas include the new imaging modalities, hybrid detection methods, photoacoustic contrast agents and the photoacoustic Doppler effect, as well as translational research topics.},
