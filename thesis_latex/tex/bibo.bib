  abstract = {Optical coherence tomography {(OCT)} is an emerging technology for
	performing high-resolution cross-sectional imaging. {OCT} is analogous
	to ultrasound imaging, except that it uses light instead of sound.
	{OCT} can provide cross-sectional images of tissue structure on the
	micron scale in situ and in real time. Using {OCT} in combination
	with catheters and endoscopes enables high-resolution intraluminal
	imaging of organ systems. {OCT} can function as a type of optical
	biopsy and is a powerful imaging technology for medical diagnostics
	because unlike conventional histopathology which requires removal
	of a tissue specimen and processing for microscopic examination,
	{OCT} can provide images of tissue in situ and in real time. {OCT}
	can be used where standard excisional biopsy is hazardous or impossible,
	to reduce sampling errors associated with excisional biopsy, and
	to guide interventional procedures. In this paper, we review {OCT}
	technology and describe its potential biomedical and clinical applications.},

	Moreover, it is non-ionizing and non-invasive, and is the fastest
	growing new biomedical method, with clinical applications on the
	way. This review provides a brief recap of recent developments in
	photoacoustics in biomedicine, from basic principles to applications.
	The emphasized areas include the new imaging modalities, hybrid detection

  number = {5},
  abstract = {Photoacoustic microscopy ({PAM)} is a hybrid in vivo imaging technique
	that acoustically detects optical contrast via the photoacoustic
	effect. Unlike pure optical microscopic techniques, {PAM} takes advantage
	of the weak acoustic scattering in tissue and thus breaks through
	the optical diffusion limit (∼1 mm in soft tissue). With its excellent
	scalability, {PAM} can provide high-resolution images at desired
	maximum imaging depths up to a few millimeters. Compared with backscattering-based
	confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography, {PAM} provides
	absorption contrast instead of scattering contrast. Furthermore,
	{PAM} can image more molecules, endogenous or exogenous, at their
	absorbing wavelengths than fluorescence-based methods, such as wide-field,
	confocal, and multi-photon microscopy. Most importantly, {PAM} can
	simultaneously image anatomical, functional, molecular, flow dynamic
	and metabolic contrasts in vivo. Focusing on state-of-the-art developments
	in {PAM}, this Review discusses the key features of {PAM} implementations
	and their applications in biomedical studies.},

  abstract = {Although optical absorption is strongly associated with the physiological
	status of biological tissue, existing high-resolution optical imaging
	modalities, including confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy
	and optical coherence tomography, do not sense optical absorption
	directly. Furthermore, optical scattering prevents these methods
	from imaging deeper than 1 mm below the tissue surface. Here we report
	functional photoacoustic microscopy ({fPAM)}, which provides multiwavelength
	imaging of optical absorption and permits high spatial resolution
	beyond this depth limit with a ratio of maximum imaging depth to
	depth resolution greater than 100. Reflection mode, rather than orthogonal
	or transmission mode, is adopted because it is applicable to more
	anatomical sites than the others. {fPAM} is demonstrated with in
	vivo imaging of angiogenesis, melanoma, hemoglobin oxygen saturation
	({sO2)} of single vessels in animals and total hemoglobin concentration
	in humans.},
